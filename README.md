# comp20-ajohnson
This Git repository contains work done in Comp 20: Web Development (Spring 2017).

## Favorite Assignment
My favorite assignment was building the black car server. I had created a Web App with JumboCode using Flask, but I was unclear on many things. Building the black car server on my own really clearified how such servers work and how to connect a UI to a database.

## Growth
I like to compare where I am now to that JumboCode project (Talloires Network) from the fall. I was more or less lost then and now I have gone back to that repo to try and understand it better, and even though it was written in Flask I was able to understand most everything and was a lot less intimidated to learn what I didn't understand.
I think that's what was most valuable to me: Between JavaScript, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Nodejs + Express, ... I learned a lot that I found overwhelming and intimidating a semester ago.

## Most Important Thing Learned
For me this has to be how to write a web server using Nodejs + Express. I was able to use that skill to help my IDHack team create our 2nd place project that sends JSON from a mobile App to a server, which stores the data in an Excel file. It also helped me understand exactly how our Flask App that we created for JumboCode works on a much deeper level.

## What now?
Now that the course is over, I would like to spend time delving deeper into security. I found the last assignment very fun and isightful, it has prompted me to go back to our IDHack project and redo some of the server to not trust user inputs. Although Comp 116 filled up before I had a chance to register, I hope to be able to take the course my senior year.
